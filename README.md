# Payment Service API

This is a simple payment service API that exposes endpoints to receive payment requests, generate a checkout link, and handle webhook updates for authentication. Upon successful authentication, the API sends a confirmation email to the buyer.

## Usage

update env variables accordingly(use a tunnel service to expose localhost, such as ngrok and update BASE_URL)
run npm install then npm start
